Spybot/Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident Netload files

The following three snd_netload files were recovered by r543 from the Internet Explorer cache of an old Windows XP Computer and had their extension renamed from .cct to .cst to open them easier.
The [1] in the name comes from how Internet Explorer caches files.

> brian151 : re-named to .cct, removed "[1]" as it's not necesarry

Below are the SHA-1 hashes of each file:

snd_netload_2

Please give credit when using/posting those and let me know if you happen to have the missing snd_netload_1 & snd_netload_4 files.

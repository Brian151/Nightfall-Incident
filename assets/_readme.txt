[key]
"name" : a single director cast from the game
"_name" : additional files/folders that are not part of the original game

animations: contains four film loops (can't export), and the frames for them.
I exported the frames and will re-assemble the animations later. Used for the 
animations when your spybot is connecting to a node.

levelData: The data for EVERY map in the released game, I combined it all
together into one file.

misc: tons and tons of configuration data

snd_netload_<1-5> :
external casts containing additional audio files + settings
    /gamelab , /r543 :
        files provided by gamelab, files recovered & provided by r543
        /SWA , /WAV
            audio extracted in SWA ("original") and WAV formats

sound: most of the sounds and music for the game, and various settings for how to
play them are found here.

text data: more configuration data, and also contains nearly all of the dialogue.

tiles: Contains almost everything found in a databattle. (tiles, program graphics,
item graphics)

tutorial: Contains the text, and basically all of the graphics used in the
tutorial level. Seems to be haphazardly organized, and I wonder if it might
be one of the oldest sections of the game.

visual: lots and lots of film loops, buttons, and some flash assets, and PLENTY
of bitmaps. Most of what's here seems to be intended for the GUI or game background
almost exclusively.

visual/illuminati_confirmed.bmp | original name : "cool_credit.bmp"

visual/SWF_extracted : 
extracted contents of flash files

worldMap: this contains the netmap background, node graphics, and the line
overlays.

_checklist: marks which casts have been entirely processed (or as far as
I will consider "entirely")

_readme: this file

_temp: various WIP stuff, typically attempts to hard-rip certain assets

_TSR: The only known public rips from this game until I released my stuff,
came from the Spriters Resource. The methods by which they were ripped
are unknown.
